This is the list of 9 GRASP patterns (sometimes called principles but please, do not focus on naming here):

1. Information Expert
2. Creator
3. Controller
4. Low Coupling
5. High Cohesion
6. Indirection
7. Polymorphism
8. Pure Fabrication
9. Protected Variations

## https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/fitness-function-driven-development

#### Stability and agility are often diametrically opposed because of the way they are pursued. We attempt to achieve stability by establishing control over change and creating gatekeepers, while innovation and agility are enabled by reducing barriers to change in order to minimize the chance of failure. Shifting the mindset to value ‘mean time to recovery’ (MTTR) over ‘mean time between failure’ (MTBF) and embracing constant change is a challenge. Evaluating stakeholder motivation and holistically prioritizing the qualities that are important to the organization is the first step in defining architectural fitness functions. This initial exercise is similar to a cross-functional requirements session with the outcome of producing the desired fitness functions.
